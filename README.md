take a look at https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general it's made for 2-player adverserial games so I'm trying to modify it for
single player slay the spire.

I think it's mostly done there

still needs an actual neural network setup and to hook into Slay-I

also needs to randomly assign the monster encounters (probably should be w/ the true probabilities in the game - ill check the wiki)
